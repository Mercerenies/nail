NAIL
by Mercerenies
--------------

This is not a complete entry, but it's still playable, so I hope you
have some fun with it. NAIL is an economy trading game loosely based
on the old poem "For Want of a Nail" and incorporating characters from
various storybooks into it in some form or another.

I won't say too much here, but read the AFTERWORD for some details on
what had to be cut and what the original vision was.
